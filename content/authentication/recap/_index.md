## Recap

1. Had a quick look at how JWT works in theory, how it is secure, and what would make it more secure
2. What oauth2 looks like and what the flow entails
3. We looked at JWT authentication without using libs
4. User + email with Passport


## Workout

1. Implement role based auth using JWT and optionally add a protected view.
2. Create a Github app and add oauth2 using the passportjs library and the `passport-github2` plugin
